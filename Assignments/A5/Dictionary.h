 * Class Description: Dictionary data collection ADT class.
 *                    The implementation of this class is based on 
 *                    the hashing strategy and the open addressing 
 *                    collision resolution strategy called linear probing hashing. 
 *            
 * Class Invariant: Each element stored in this Dictionary is unique (no duplications allowed).

  // Space Efficiency: O(1), all of the usernames have fixed size of 16 characters

  //            For example, if the operator "new" fails, or Dictionary is full (temporary solution).
