 * List.cpp - Implementation of the List class

 * Class Description: A data collection List ADT class:
 *                    linked list-based implementation.
 *                    Its underlying data structure is a
 *                    singly-headed singly-linked list (SHSL).
 *
 * List Characteristics: Not kept in sorted order.
 *                       Duplication allowed.

 * Note that there is some debate about whether or not this type of
 * method belongs in a class. The argument (briefly) is that a class
 * shouldn't be responsible for I/O by "displaying" itself as it cannot
 * foresee how it is to be displayed (in a TUI or GUI environment).
 * However, such method eases testing.
 * For testing purpose, unless required by client in problem statement.
 * Could also overload operator<<.
